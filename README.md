# Overview
This ontology is used for semantically describing assets in Knowledge Lake Management System (KLMS). Based on the [Data Catalog Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) (DCAT) it can describe various properties of a dataset (e.g., title, description, release date, update frequency, size, format, license). It also encompasses the [Data Profiling Vocabulary](https://github.com/stelar-eu/data-profiling-vocabulary) (DPV) for representing content-related metadata about different types of datasets: tabular, hierarchical, geospatial (vector and raster), RDF graphs, and textual documents. Furthermore, the KLMS ontology also describes workflow specifications with processing tasks involving such datasets as their input and output, also keeping track of their parameters and performance metrics (quality indicators, execution times, etc.).
